[![.github/workflows/build.yml](https://github.com/NarrikSynthfox/FuserCustomSongCreator/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NarrikSynthfox/FuserCustomSongCreator/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## Introduction

A small UI to create custom songs for Fuser! Requires [Fuser Song Loader](https://github.com/NarrikSynthfox/FuserSongLoader/) to function.
## Notes

A　Small Fork to accomodate the [Custom Chords mod](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MI1G1l7FhL-KB7muAVgyIcqKqEQFKxnz/view?usp=sharing)

## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elenasayshi/FuserCustomSongCreator.git
cd FuserCustomSongCreator
./build.bat
```
`Fuser_CustomSongCreator.sln` should be generated under the `FuserCustomSongCreator/build` folder.
